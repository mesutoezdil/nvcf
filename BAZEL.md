# Bazel in the NVCF monorepo

This file is the contributor-facing guide for the Bazel build path in the
NVCF umbrella repository. Bazel is the build engine for onboarded subtrees;
upstream-owned subtrees keep their existing build paths until they are
explicitly integrated.

## Current Scope

Bazel currently builds, tests, and packages:

- `src/clis/nvcf-cli` (Go binary + multi-platform release matrix + OCI image)
- `src/libraries/go/lib` (Go library, 92 targets)
- `src/libraries/java/nv-boot-parent` (Java framework libraries and tests)
- `src/control-plane-services/cloud-tasks` (Java libraries, tests, and Spring
  Boot application)
- `src/control-plane-services/notary` (Java libraries, tests, and Spring Boot
  application)
- `src/control-plane-services/api-keys` (Java tests and Spring Boot
  application)

Other upstream-owned subtrees remain excluded until they are onboarded one at
a time. `nv-boot-parent` and onboarded Java service directories are folded
into the root Bazel module and are not nested Bazel workspaces.

## One-time setup

### Linux

```bash
# Bazelisk pins the right Bazel version per repo via .bazelversion.
curl -fSL -o ~/.local/bin/bazel \
  "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.25.0/bazelisk-linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture)"
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/bazel

# Toolchain prerequisites for the Go and OCI rules.
sudo apt-get install -y gcc g++ git make python3 lld
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/ld ld /usr/bin/ld.lld 100

# Confirm setup.
bazel version
bazel info release
```

There is also `setup.sh` at the repo root that installs Bazelisk into
`~/.local/bin` if you prefer a script.

### macOS

```bash
# Apple Silicon and Intel both work; Bazelisk picks the right binary.
brew install bazelisk

# git is preinstalled with Xcode CLT; install if needed.
xcode-select --install || true

# (Optional) lld for cross-compiling Linux binaries from your Mac.
brew install llvm
ln -sfn "$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin/ld.lld" "$(brew --prefix)/bin/ld.lld"

bazel version
bazel info release
```

The OCI image targets cross-compile Linux binaries from your Mac via the
`hermetic_cc_toolchain` (Zig). No additional setup is needed; Bazel fetches
the cross-toolchain on first use.

### Common environment

The repo expects Bazel 9.1.1 (pinned in `.bazelversion`). Bazelisk handles
the download automatically; do not install Bazel via apt or brew directly,
as that pins a different version.

Java targets use Java 25 with the root `.bazelrc` setting
`--java_runtime_version=local_jdk`. The pinned containerized CI image supplies
Temurin 25 through `JAVA_HOME`. The Docker-host lane downloads and configures
Temurin 25 through the workflow's `actions/setup-java@v4` step.

For local Java work, install an organization-approved full JDK 25 and point
`JAVA_HOME` at it:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="<path-to-jdk-25>"
export PATH="${JAVA_HOME}/bin:${PATH}"
java --version
```

Java services with Testcontainers tests and the nv-boot Cassandra tests also
require a running Docker daemon. Use Docker Desktop on macOS or Docker Engine
on Linux.

`bazel info java-home` reports the Java runtime used to run the Bazel server.
That directory is not guaranteed to contain command-line tools such as
`javac`, so it is not the right way to inspect the Java toolchains selected for
build actions. Query those toolchains directly:

```bash
bazel cquery @bazel_tools//tools/jdk:current_java_runtime \
  --output=starlark \
  --starlark:expr='str(providers(target)["ToolchainInfo"].java_runtime.version)'

bazel cquery @bazel_tools//tools/jdk:current_host_java_runtime \
  --output=starlark \
  --starlark:expr='str(providers(target)["ToolchainInfo"].java_runtime.version)'
```

Both commands must print `25`. The normal Java build then proves that the
compiler toolchain works; a separate `javac` command under
`bazel info java-home` is neither required nor expected.

## Java In The Root Module

`nv-boot-parent` and onboarded Java services are ordinary source directories
inside the single root `nvcf` Bazel module. They do not have nested
`MODULE.bazel`, `.bazelrc`, `.bazelversion`, downloader configuration, or
dependency lockfiles. Run their Bazel commands from this repository root.

For someone familiar with Maven, these root files divide responsibilities that
often live in a parent POM, Maven settings, and the local repository:

| Root file | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.bazelversion` | Tells Bazelisk which Bazel release to run. |
| `.bazelrc` | Supplies shared Bazel flags, Java 25 toolchain settings, and downloader configuration. |
| `.bazel_downloader_config` | Redirects supported external downloads through approved mirrors. It does not declare dependencies. |
| `MODULE.bazel` | Declares Bazel rule modules, BOM imports, and the roots of the shared third-party Java graph. |
| `maven_install.json` | Locks resolved third-party Java artifacts, relationships, repositories, and checksums. Its name describes Maven-compatible coordinates; it does not run Maven. |
| `MODULE.bazel.lock` | Locks Bzlmod modules and module-extension evaluation. It is separate from the Java artifact lock. |

Commit changes to these files together when one dependency update affects more
than one of them. Do not edit either lockfile manually.

All Java components use the root-owned `@nv_third_party_deps` hub for external
jars. The hub contains third-party artifacts only. `nv-boot-parent` and each
service remain first-party source targets referenced with direct labels such
as:

```text
//src/libraries/java/nv-boot-parent/nv-boot-starter-core:nv_boot_starter_core
//src/control-plane-services/<service-directory>/<module>:<target>
```

Set a portable output root once per local shell:

```bash
export BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/nvcf-bazel-cache"
export JAVA_SERVICE_DIR="src/control-plane-services/<service-directory>"
export JAVA_APP_MODULE="<spring-boot-app-module>"
```

Replace the angle-bracket placeholders with the service directory and its
Spring Boot application module. The component's own `BAZEL.md` supplies its
exact values and targets.

Build or test the complete framework or one Java service:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build //src/libraries/java/nv-boot-parent/...

bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test //src/libraries/java/nv-boot-parent/... \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors

bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build "//${JAVA_SERVICE_DIR}/..."

bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  test "//${JAVA_SERVICE_DIR}/..." \
  --cache_test_results=no \
  --test_output=errors
```

When the selected scope includes Testcontainers tests, the complete suite
requires a running Docker daemon. `bazel test` automatically builds the code
needed by the selected tests; a separate build is useful for compile-only
feedback and for non-test products such as the Spring Boot app jar.

Build the selected service's executable app jar with:

```bash
bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  build "//${JAVA_SERVICE_DIR}/${JAVA_APP_MODULE}:app"
```

Its output is:

```text
bazel-bin/src/control-plane-services/<service-directory>/<spring-boot-app-module>/app.jar
```

Real Java test, JUnit, and JaCoCo outputs are under each target's
`bazel-testlogs/<component>/<module>/tests/test.outputs` directory. The
component guides provide commands for one module, class, or method and for
NOTICE, OSRB, Docker, and Maven coexistence:

```text
src/libraries/java/nv-boot-parent/BAZEL.md
src/control-plane-services/<service-directory>/BAZEL.md
```

When the shared third-party Java graph changes, repin it from the root:

```bash
REPIN=1 bazel --output_user_root="${BAZEL_OUTPUT_USER_ROOT}" \
  run @nv_third_party_deps//:pin
```

Java CI registration is component-local. Each component owns one
`bazel-java-ci.json`; `.github/workflows/bazel.yml` discovers those files and
derives shared-Java triggers, framework-to-service validation, CI execution
environment, and artifact upload. Use `ci_lane: docker-host` when any component
test requires Docker and `ci_lane: build-container` otherwise. Java root scope
is implicit and is not a descriptor option. The detector supports
dependency-aware selection, but current policy deliberately runs the full
matrix on every PR and push for regression safety.

The same descriptor also registers the component with the repository
dependency collector. Every registered Java component must expose:

```text
//<component-directory>:runtime_inventory.json
```

The collector builds all registered inventories and merges the dependencies
actually used by those runtime targets into root `dependencies.md`:

```bash
go run ./tools/collect-dependencies
```

This does not scan project POM files and does not list every artifact available
in `maven_install.json`. The root lockfile keeps the complete shared Java graph;
component runtime inventories identify the used subset. See
`tools/collect-dependencies/README.md` for the complete model and prerequisites.

## Regenerate `dependencies.md`

Regenerate root `dependencies.md` when:

- a component is added to or removed from the monorepo
- a Go, Rust, Python, Java, or Helm dependency is added, removed, or upgraded
- a Java BUILD target changes the component's runtime dependency graph
- `MODULE.bazel` or `maven_install.json` changes the Java dependency graph

Run this command from the repository root:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
  go run ./tools/collect-dependencies
```

The GitHub token provides authenticated license metadata lookups and avoids
low unauthenticated API limits. If `gh` is unavailable, omit the first line;
generation still works but may be slower or leave some license metadata
unresolved.

Component discovery is automatic. Java components are found through
`bazel-java-ci.json`; the other supported languages are found from their
dependency manifests. The command may leave `dependencies.md` unchanged when a
new component uses only dependencies already present in the repository-wide
rollup.

GitHub Actions regenerates the file and fails when the checked-in copy is
stale. CI does not commit the update, so include a changed `dependencies.md` in
the same commit as the dependency or component change.

## Day-to-day commands

### Build

```bash
# Native binary for your host platform.
bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:nvcf-cli

# All five release binaries (linux/darwin/windows x amd64/arm64).
bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:dist

# All Go libraries.
bazel build //src/libraries/go/lib/...

# Everything Bazel knows about.
bazel build //...
```

### Test

```bash
# All CLI tests (11 targets, sandboxed).
bazel test //src/clis/nvcf-cli/...

# All library tests (51 targets; 41 pass, 10 are flagged for testdata cleanup).
bazel test //src/libraries/go/lib/...

# Stream output even when tests pass.
bazel test //src/clis/nvcf-cli/... --test_output=streamed
```

The Bazel sandbox strips `$HOME` and `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`; `.bazelrc` re-exports
both pointing at `/tmp` so cobra/viper/git-cache code paths do not blow up
on first reference. If you add a test that needs more env, declare it on the
`go_test` rule via `env = {...}`.

### OCI image

```bash
# Build the host-arch image.
bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:image

# Build the multi-arch index (amd64 + arm64) using the zig cross-toolchain.
bazel build //src/clis/nvcf-cli:image_index

# Load the host-arch image into your local docker daemon.
bazel run //src/clis/nvcf-cli:image_load
docker images | grep nvcf-cli

# Push the multi-arch index to the project registry (manual; needs docker login).
bazel run --stamp //src/clis/nvcf-cli:image_push
```

The image push uses `tools/workspace_status.sh` to compute tags. With
`--stamp` enabled, the index is published with `latest`, the version
(`$NVCF_VERSION` on release builds, else `mr-<sha>`), and the short commit.

### Generate or refresh BUILD files

After adding a Go file or import, run Gazelle to regenerate per-package
BUILD files:

```bash
bazel run //:gazelle

# If you added a new external Go module, refresh use_repo entries too:
bazel mod tidy
```

Gazelle is configured to skip everything outside the current native scope, so it will
not touch upstream-owned subtrees or vendored directories.

#### Rust equivalent

There is no Gazelle equivalent for Rust. BUILD files for `rust_library`
and `rust_binary` targets are written by hand; only third-party crate
metadata is generated, by `crate_universe`. When you edit a Rust crate's
`Cargo.toml` or `Cargo.lock`, repin the crate index:

```bash
# Repin all crate_universe hubs in the module graph:
CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=1 bazel mod deps

# Narrow to a single hub (faster):
CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN=true CARGO_BAZEL_REPIN_ALLOWLIST=<hub_name> bazel mod deps
```

Do not run `bazel sync --only=...` here. `bazel sync` is a WORKSPACE-mode
command and Bazel 8 rejects it on bzlmod-only repos with
`ERROR: WORKSPACE has to be enabled for sync command to work`.

Commit any diffs to `Cargo.lock` and `MODULE.bazel.lock`.

### Build graph queries (useful for review)

```bash
# Show every target in nvcf-cli.
bazel query //src/clis/nvcf-cli/...

# Show what nvcf-cli depends on (transitively, just our own packages).
bazel query 'kind(go_library, deps(//src/clis/nvcf-cli:nvcf-cli)) intersect //src/...'

# Show the module dependency graph.
bazel mod graph --depth=2

# Compute reverse deps: who depends on the lib's auth package?
bazel query 'rdeps(//..., //src/libraries/go/lib/pkg/auth:auth)'
```

## Caches

Three layers, in priority order from fastest to slowest:

1. **Local action cache** under `~/.cache/bazel/`. Incremental, per-target.
2. **Local repository cache** under `~/.cache/bazel/`. External module
   downloads (Go modules, OCI base images, Zig toolchain). Survives
   `bazel clean`.
3. **Remote cache**. Enabled by default via `.bazelrc` as a read-only cache;
   CI layers on `--config=remote-write` after probing the cache endpoint.

`bazel clean` purges local build outputs but keeps the repo cache.
`bazel clean --expunge` purges everything (rare; recovers from corrupted
cache or stale toolchain pinning).

In CI (`bazel-smoke` job in root `.gitlab-ci.yml`) both local caches are
persisted to `${CI_PROJECT_DIR}/.bazel-cache` and registered in GitLab's
`cache:` keyed on `MODULE.bazel.lock`, so the second pipeline run is fast.

### Remote cache

The repo enables the read-only `--config=remote` profile by default in
`.bazelrc`. The behaviorally important lines are:

```
build --config=remote
build:remote --remote_cache=grpc://<remote-cache-endpoint>
build:remote --remote_upload_local_results=false
build:remote --remote_cache_compression
build:remote --remote_timeout=120
build:remote --remote_retries=5
build:remote --remote_max_connections=50
build:remote --remote_local_fallback
build:remote-write --config=remote
build:remote-write --remote_upload_local_results=true
```

When invoked:

- Bazel checks the remote action cache before executing each compile/test.
  Cache hit -> the action's outputs are downloaded and the action is not
  re-executed.
- Cache miss -> action runs locally. Local developer builds do not upload
  results by default, which avoids cache poisoning from non-hermetic local
  environments. CI uses `--config=remote-write` to populate the cache.
- Per-action remote cache failures are covered by `--remote_local_fallback`,
  so Bazel continues locally and prints a warning for those failures.
- The initial remote Capabilities RPC is not covered by
  `--remote_local_fallback`. If the cache endpoint cannot be resolved or the
  cache frontend is fully unreachable, Bazel can fail before local execution
  starts.

Local opt-out / override:

```bash
# One-shot local-only build.
bazel build --remote_cache= //src/clis/nvcf-cli:nvcf-cli

# Persistent local-only override.
echo 'build --remote_cache=' >> ~/.bazelrc.user

# Workspace-local override, useful for one checkout only.
echo 'build --remote_cache=' >> user.bazelrc
```

Do not use `--noremote_cache`; `--remote_cache` is a string flag, not a
boolean flag, so Bazel rejects the `no` prefix. `user.bazelrc` is in
`.gitignore`-conventions territory; it lets you set personal defaults
without polluting the shared `.bazelrc`.

CI scope: the per-CLI Bazel jobs (`go-test`, `go-build`,
`verify-agent-skill-manifest` in `tools/ci/nvcf-cli.yml`) and umbrella
jobs inherit the default read-only cache. CI jobs add `--config=remote-write`
only after their preflight probe confirms that the remote cache is reachable.

### Lifecycle and ownership

- **Host**: managed by the NVCF team and reviewed on the team's normal
  infrastructure cadence.
- **Provisioning**: managed by the NVCF team through the internal
  remote-cache automation.
- **Storage**: starts modest; expansion happens out-of-band as cache
  size grows. If you observe high cache-miss rates after large ingestion
  windows, check the cache browser for eviction patterns.
- **Failure mode**: builds with `--config=remote --remote_local_fallback`
  degrade to local execution on action errors but hard-fail on initial
  Capabilities RPC failure (e.g., backend storage shards down).
  CI guards against this in two layers (see `.bazel-remote-probe` in
  `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `.bazel-cli` in `tools/ci/nvcf-cli.yml`):
  1. Each Bazel job's `before_script` does a 5-second TCP probe of
     the remote-cache endpoint. If it fails, `--config=remote` is
     dropped for that run and the job continues with local cache only,
     instead of hanging Bazel on the Capabilities RPC.
  2. A CI/CD variable `NVCF_BAZEL_REMOTE` (default `1`) can be set to
     `0` in GitLab project settings to force local-only across all
     Bazel jobs without a code push. Useful when the remote cache is degraded
     in a way the TCP probe can't detect (port open, gRPC wedged).
- **End of lease**: either renew, migrate to longer-term host, or roll
  back to local-only caching. The per-service opt-in pattern means
  the rollback footprint is small.

Inspecting cache hits/misses: open the build's invocation in the cache browser
(set Bazel's `--bes_results_url` locally if you want clickable links per
build).

## CI

Every workflow that needs the Bazel toolchain runs in the `bazel-ci` job
container, sourced from the repository variable `BAZEL_CI_IMAGE` (currently
`ghcr.io/nvidia/nvcf/bazel-ci`). Each workflow carries the current pin as a
`||` fallback so CI still runs when the variable is unavailable, for example on
a fork.

That image is built in the internal
[`nvcf/bazel-ci-templates`](https://gitlab-master.nvidia.com/nvcf/bazel-ci-templates)
project, stamped with a version, and mirrored to GHCR. The mirror is currently
manual; automation is planned. To change the image's Bazel, Java, or operating
system tooling, update the internal template first, publish and mirror a new
tag, then update the `BAZEL_CI_IMAGE` repository variable. Do not hardcode the
tag per workflow: it drifted to three different versions across workflows and
this document before the variable was introduced.

The root `ci/Dockerfile.bazel` and `.github/workflows/bazel-ci-image.yml` were a
stale, divergent copy (no Java, older Bazel) and have been removed. The image is
built in `nvcf/bazel-ci-templates` and mirrored to ghcr (see above); this repo
does not build it.

The detect job also enforces the single-module import boundary:

```bash
bash tools/ci/check-java-import-boundaries
```

Run this after refreshing `nv-boot-parent` or an onboarded Java service. It
fails when a standalone Bazel root file, lockfile, workspace file, or migration
directory is reintroduced under an imported subtree.

The existing internal Bazel jobs include:

- `bazel-smoke`: pulls the image, runs `bazel info release`, then
  `bazel build --config=remote //src/libraries/go/lib/...
  //src/clis/nvcf-cli:image_index` and `bazel mod graph`. It does not
  rebuild `//src/clis/nvcf-cli/...` because the per-CLI child pipeline
  (`nvcf-cli-ci` -> `go-test`/`go-build`) already covers that against
  the same remote cache. Adding CLI targets back here just burns
  bandwidth and runner time without improving signal.
- `bazel-image-push` (manual): runs `bazel run --stamp --config=remote
  //src/clis/nvcf-cli:image_push`. With the remote cache warm from the
  per-CLI build, the image layers come straight out of the remote cache.

Per-service jobs in `tools/ci/nvcf-cli.yml` (`go-test`, `go-build`)
were rewritten to use Bazel; the legacy `Makefile` was deleted. Downstream
archive/package/publish/ngc-push stages still consume
`src/clis/nvcf-cli/build/nvcf-cli-{platform}` files, which the bazel-driven
`go-build` job now populates by copying out of `bazel-bin`.

## Stamping (release metadata)

`bazel build --stamp //src/clis/nvcf-cli:nvcf-cli` injects:

| Symbol | Source |
|---|---|
| `main.Version` | `$NVCF_VERSION` when set (release builds), else `mr-<short-sha>` |
| `main.GitCommit` | `git rev-parse --short HEAD` (with `-dirty` suffix if working tree is dirty) |
| `main.GitBranch` | `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` |
| `main.BuildDate` | UTC ISO timestamp |
| `main.BuildUser` | `whoami`, override via `$NVCF_BUILD_USER` |
| `main.GoVersion` | constant `bazel-rules_go`, override via `$NVCF_GO_VERSION` |

The script that emits these values is `tools/workspace_status.sh`. CI sets
`$NVCF_VERSION` and `$NVCF_BUILD_USER` so release builds carry the same
metadata the legacy `Makefile` injected via `-ldflags -X`.

Without `--stamp`, the defaults declared in `main.go` (`Version = "dev"`,
etc.) are used, which keeps developer iteration fast (no git invocation per
build).

## Adding a new Go module

For native subtrees outside the current scope:

1. Add the module path to `go.work.bazel` under `use (...)`.
2. Add or update its `go.mod`.
3. Add a `BUILD.bazel` at the subtree root with at least:
   `# gazelle:prefix <module-path>` and `# gazelle:exclude vendor` if it has one.
4. Remove the subtree from `.bazelignore` and from the
   `# gazelle:exclude <subtree>` lines in the root `BUILD.bazel`.
5. Run `bazel run //:gazelle` then `bazel mod tidy`.
6. `bazel build //path/to/subtree/...` to validate.

The public checkout does not contain the internal source-mirroring
configuration. For an upstream-owned subtree, distinguish between source files
that continue to mirror from the standalone repository and monorepo-native
Bazel overlays. The import process must exclude standalone `MODULE.bazel`,
lockfiles, `.bazelrc`, `.bazelversion`, downloader config, dependency hub,
and `bazel-enablement` content. Root-module BUILD adaptations and monorepo
agent/documentation overlays must be preserved during refreshes.

## Per-service publish cadence

Each subtree publishes on its own terms. The umbrella stack release lives
in `deploy/stacks/self-managed/` and is independent. Before copy-pasting
the `nvcf-cli` Bazel publish pattern onto a new service, check that
service's existing `.gitlab-ci.yml` for its current cadence and mirror
it in the rules of the Bazel-driven publish job:

| Cadence | Example services | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Tag only | `nvcf-cli` (current Bazel CLI) | `if: '$CI_COMMIT_TAG'` (manual gate optional) |
| Every merge to main | Several control-plane and invocation-plane services | `if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH` |
| Scheduled or manual | Niche services and tools | `when: manual` or pipeline schedule |

Knock-on choices that follow from the cadence:

- Version derivation (`tools/workspace_status.sh`). The version is
  `$NVCF_VERSION` when set (release builds pass the clean semver) and
  `mr-<sha>` otherwise, so every non-release build produces a distinct
  SHA-style OCI tag without semver implication.

- OCI tag set on push. Tag-driven services typically push
  `:latest`, `:<semver>`, `:<short-sha>`. Per-merge services usually
  push `:latest` and `:<short-sha>` only.

- GitLab cache pressure. Per-merge services trigger Bazel on every main
  commit, so the project-scoped cache (`MODULE.bazel.lock` keyed) sees
  more churn. The cache strategy still works; expect more frequent
  cache repopulations after `MODULE.bazel.lock` updates.

- Image push job rules. Reuse the cadence rule at the job level rather
  than gating via job stage; this keeps the publish stage flexible per
  service without restructuring the parent pipeline. Example for a
  per-merge service:

  ```yaml
  oci-image-push:
    extends: .bazel-cli
    stage: publish
    script:
      - bazel run --stamp //path/to/service:image_push
    rules:
      - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  ```

Do not unify these into a single helper template across services. The
cadence is intentionally per-service and is owned by that service's
maintainers; centralising it would couple unrelated release decisions.

## Troubleshooting

- `unknown repo '...' requested` during build: usually means `MODULE.bazel`
  needs a `use_repo` entry. Run `bazel mod tidy` and rebuild.
- `Failed to query remote execution capabilities` or
  `UNAVAILABLE: Unable to resolve host` during build: your environment may not
  be able to reach the configured remote cache. Re-run the command with
  `--remote_cache=` or add `build --remote_cache=` to `~/.bazelrc.user` for a
  persistent local-only override.
- `compilepkg: missing strict dependencies`: the BUILD file under-declares
  its `deps`. Run `bazel run //:gazelle` to regenerate, or hand-add the
  missing target to `deps`.
- Build fails with stale BUILD content after `git pull`: try
  `bazel clean` (not `--expunge`); the repo cache is fine to keep.
- macOS multi-arch image build fails fetching the Zig toolchain: confirm
  outbound HTTPS to `ziglang.org` is allowed by your network policy.
- `bazel info release` blocks for >30 s on first run: it is downloading the
  pinned Bazel binary. One-time cost.

## Additional Subtree Rollout

Per-service rollout state for upstream-owned subtrees is tracked in an internal
plan that references upstream GitLab URLs and per-service rollout state that
does not belong in the public mirror, including which upstream MRs are open,
which are merged, and which umbrella `imports.yaml` bumps have landed. Update
that internal plan as each service moves through the playbook.

## Out of scope (Later Phase)

- Wiring upstream-owned subtrees listed in `imports.yaml`. One MR per upstream
  owner. See the tracker.
- Migrating goreleaser-driven release stages
  (archive/package/publish/ngc-push) onto Bazel-native equivalents (e.g.
  `pkg_tar`, `oci_push`, custom rules for NGC). Today the artifact
  contracts are preserved via copy-from-bazel-bin shims in CI.
- Go coverage report publication in CI. Java JUnit and JaCoCo reports are
  already generated and uploaded by their component lanes.
- Lint integration. `golangci-lint` still runs as a separate job and is
  not yet wrapped into a Bazel rule.
